\textbf{Can everyone see the note I just made?}\\

You control who is able to see your note. To change who your note is shared with or add someone to the note, begin typing a contact, list, or group's name in the sharing field and click on them to share. To remove a person, group, or list, hover over their name in the sharing field, and an "x" will appear. Click the x to remove. If no one is listed in the sharing field, the note will be private and only you can access it.
