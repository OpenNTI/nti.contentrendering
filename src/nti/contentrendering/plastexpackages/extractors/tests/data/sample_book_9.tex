Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a blender.

The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that still must be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.

When water collects on a road, a vehicle can hydroplane. \ntiglossaryentry{\textbf{Hydroplaning}}{\textbf{Hydroplaning }--- Condition in which moving tires (automobile or aircraft) are separated from pavement surfaces by steam and/or water or liquid rubber film, resulting in loss of mechanical braking effectiveness.} is a condition in which directional control is partially or totally lost because of water on the roadway. It is caused when the tires lose contact with the road surface and have little or no traction. Braking and steering may not be possible while hydroplaning.

\chapter{Chapter 2}
\label{chapter:2}

This chapter consist of 2 sections.

\section{Section 2.1}
\label{section:2-1}

If your education program is built for only one type of learning, you may be missing out on gaining new members and increasing non-dues revenue. Thus, increasing education options, especially online, is likely to lead to increased participation and revenue.

\subsection{Sub Section 2.1.1}
\label{subsection:2-2-1}

The same training you offer at conferences may not work best online. While recorded webinars are the simplest way to scale up online courses, they aren't always the most effective. There are better ways to build online learning experiences, if you design accordingly. 

\subsection{Sub Section 2.1.2}
\label{subsection:2-2-2}

For example, you can increase retention by breaking videos into multiple, shorter segments and interlacing those videos with readings, surveys and interactive experiences. Also, there are many ways to harness the power of community with online learning Fostering discussion groups and community resource sharing within your learning community is one of the best ways to engage learners. It is ideal if you can foster community within your learning management system.

\section{Section 2.2}
\label{section:2-2}
Conferences and online education offerings can benefit from each other. For instance, you can expand on successful classes at conferences by offering "going deeper" classes online. Conversely, if you find an online course is popular, expand on it by offering a related option at your conference. In-person and online trainings can build and feed off each other to provide your members with a more well-rounded education experiences.
